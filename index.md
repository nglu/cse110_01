# Hello there!

![I'm here](http://explorevenango.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cat-tok.jpg)

## About me
I'm Nguyen Luong - a 3rd year student major in Computer Science at UC San Diego. Nice to meet you here!

Apart from doing coding stuff, here's a list of my ***favorite*** things to do:
- Reading books, mostly fiction
- Cooking ExOtIc fOoD (meaning it tastes so weird that no one in my family wants to eat it)
- Swimming. Yes, **pools are opened**!

This is my favorite quote from the movie "I, Robot"
> "Rules are made to be broken"

The first lines of code that I've written were in Java, and I believe most people would know what it is:
```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
}
```

Personal goal-wise, my future version will:
- [ ] Have a dog
- [ ] Have a cat
- [ ] Have a Jeep
- [x] Be a nice person

## Current projects
Here are some projects that I have worked on:
1. Creating my own website. You can find the User Page [here](https://github.com/nglu/cse110_01#cse110_01), and the README file [here](README.md).
2. Compressing & decompressing a file by applying Huffman Coding Tree.
3. Finding shortest path for weighted and unweighted graphs.
